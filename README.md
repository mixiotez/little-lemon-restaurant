# Little Lemon Restaurant

Facebook Meta's Capstone Project for the Meta Frontend Developer certification. Created with Vite, React, and Material UI.

## Installation

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

## Limitations

* The certificate only asks for the home and reservation pages to be developed, so other links do not render the desired pages – these might be completed in the future
* The form does not validate the time input – it might be easier to use a select dropdown instead
* The form does not submit the information anyway and no email is sent to the diner
* Twitter Card and OG image meta tags are missing
